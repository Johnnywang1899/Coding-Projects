# Undergraduate-Coding-Projects
Coding projects in C, C++ and MATLAB
## Overview
The repsoitory contains multiple undergraduate programming projects:
- Project_PID Controller (C): Programmed Arduino and applied PID controller to enable stable balance of the robot
- Project_Obstacle Avoidance (C): Programmed robot and ultrasonic sensors to effectively identify and avoid obstacles during navigation
- Project_Autonomous Driving (C++): Programmed TurtleBot in Linux environment and ROS platform to realize autonomous driving and picture recognition with OpenCV library
- Particle Research (MATLAB): Simulate the conductivity of polymer structure after adding carbon nanotube using MATLAB
